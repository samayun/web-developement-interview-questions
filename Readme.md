## [How to contribute](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github)

1. ### Fork the project repository

   `https://github.com/samayun/web-developement-interview-questions.git`

2. ### Clone your fork
   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/web-developement-interview-questions.git web-developement-interview-questions`
3. ### Navigate to your local repository.
   `cd web-developement-interview-questions`
4. ### Check that your fork is the "origin" remote

   `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/web-developement-interview-questions.git`

5. ### Add the project repository as the "upstream" remote
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/samayun/web-developement-interview-questions.git`
6. ### Pull the latest changes from upstream into your local repository
   `git pull upstream master`
7. ### Create a new branch same as YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
   `git checkout -b YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_AS_A_BRANCH_NAME`
8. ### Make changes in your local repository
9. ### Commit your changes `git add -A` :
   After you make a set of changes, use git add -A to stage your changes and `git commit -m "callback,closure,scope related QnA added`
10. ### Push your changes to your fork

    When you are done making all of your changes, upload these changes to your fork using git push origin BRANCH_NAME. This "pushes" your changes to the "BRANCH_NAME" branch of the "origin" (which is your fork on GitHub).

    For example, I used `git push origin pritom-dip`
